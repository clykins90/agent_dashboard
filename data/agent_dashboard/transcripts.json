I’m Pil — your bubbly guide to Pilates and Club Pilates Saratoga Springs. ✨\n\nA quick peek at what Pilates does: it helps build core strength, improve flexibility, posture, balance, and gives you a strong mind–body connection. Intro classes are a great way for first-timers to learn the fundamentals and get comfy with the reformer and other equipment.\n\nWould you like me to pull up the next available Intro classes at Club Pilates Saratoga Springs (in MST) and help you book one? I can show up to 3 options. \n\nIf you’re already a member, just a heads-up: please leave a voicemail for assistance. \n\nWhat would you like to do—check schedules, ask about class format, or something else?"
